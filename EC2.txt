============================================
>>>>
- services
- compute-EC2
- change server to Mumbai
- launch instance
- name the server
- Search for Ami
- connect Microsoft operating system: Microsoft Windows Server 2022 Base
- instance type: t2.micro, it has 1CPU,1GB memory
- key-pair: create- dwijakey  .pem- name the key- click create key- a file will be downloaded
- by default username is: administration
- n/w setting- edit- vpc must default - subnet can be chosen any but I have chosen no preferences so it was chosen by it self- auto assign IP must be enabled
- Firewall- create security group name=dwijaSecurityGroup -  description is optional -  Inbound Security Group Rules(here we create a group)=souce type=anywhere
- Configure storage=30GB SSD
- No. of instance = 1
-  Launch instance
-   View All instance 
- Reload it- then the status check will be 2/2.
===========================================================
To know machine credentials.
- The public IP of a remote machine known as Domain IP is DNS. 
- Tick the instance- below we can get public IP and private IP - copy public IP
 	Public IP= 13.126.122.178
	DNS = ec2-13-126-122-178.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
	Port = 3389 (by default of rdp)
	username = Administration(by default)
	password-select instance- click connect- 2nd tag RDP client- (from the file downloaded we cant know pw) - get pw - upload file and decrypt it- copy pw 
			pw = ZruKnCO?OGB00Li(p1Ir)?62*d1j6UfV
- Go to the start button of PC - then RDP search- Click remote desktop connection - enter PublicIP - connect - change the user name to administrator- enter Password-connect
=============================================================
Cost in Virginia is low, to calculate the cost, you can go onto Google and search
About Netflix, it used PaaS in AWS and applied a lot of cost to it. (more than 300cr of monthly billing)
Netflix, LinkedIn, Hotstar, and facebook - all companies pay's to AWS and many other companies.
======================================================================
to create web-services is a deployment service through HTTPS type pf service
most webserver are written in c++, android is a linux OS, Android and IoS is written in C Language 
IIS web service we will use.

Till above we have set all the infrastructure, OS is a platform in which we will create a web service that is s/w
This is a machine located in the Mumbai Region

- Open machine
- Start
- Control Panel - windows Feature on/off (Use to create web server)
- Then a window will open- do next next till the last step - but do select IIS web service in Server roles.
- Takes 5 mins -  Then close all and go back to the desktop
-  Go to Microsoft Edge - type localhost - if a blue screen comes then successful 
- (to deploy on) Select Instance- go to security column - click on security key - edit Inbound rules 
	- Add rule - Http - anywhere Ipv4 - Add rule
- Search for public IP on Google then you can see your website, now these websites can be opened on any device
- web route is where we have web services
- pc >> drive c >> inetpub >> wwwroot on virtual PC. 
	- Create Index file there >> EDIT it >> save as all files >> then refresh server 
- Django and React have a different process, and Python also.
- add anything in the wwwroot folder, and you will see it on your  Website - by copy from pc and pasting it in the Vm wwwroot folder 
===========================================
Closes the instance
- EC2 Dashboard, no. of instances >>  select which one you want to delete
-  select instance type >> 
- Action >> change instance setting >> change the termination protection >> enable it >> save it (this will protect from closing all the servers in the instance)
-  Change protection >> disable >>  Instance State >> Teminate
